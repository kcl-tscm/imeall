To run all the examples type:
    ``python run_all_examples.py``

The examples can be run individually as well.

query_test:
    Demonstrates a simple query to the database to pull the
    minimum energy values for a user chosen potential
    (or list of potentials), and orientation axis.
        $python query_struct.py -p 'PotBH.xml' -or 0,0,1

elastic_dipole_test:
    Calculate the elastic dipole tensor for a hydrogen atom
    in bulk Fe.
        $python ~/imeall/imeall/calc_elast_dipole.py -ct EAM -i bcc_h.xyz -rc

dissolution_test:
    Calculate dissolution energy for hydrogen in bulk BCC Fe.
        $python dissolution_energy.py

gen_grainboundaries:
    Use quaternion algebra to generate a series of canonical grain boundaries.
    $python generate_gb_example.py

boundary_interstitials:
    Generate a list of interstitial sites for a particular and obtain their energetics.

checkout_structures:
    Demonstrates how to checkout all minimum energy structures for [001] alphaFe tilt symmetric
    grain boundaries for subsequent analysis (requires local copy of database).
        $python checkout_dirs.py
